        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            This project was for a Visual Design module of my masters. The challenge was to create a brand identity for a fictional
            bicycle shop, The Studded Chain.
        </p>
        <br>
        <div class="brief">
            <p>“The Studded Chain is a soon-to-launch vintage bicycle store, selling original vintage
                bicycles and bike accessories. An integral part of the business is also to repair old bicycles,
                giving them a new lease of life. They require an identity that is fresh and current, and sets
                them aside from regular bike shops. Consider how the brand might use its online presence
                to achieve its core aims and objectives.”
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Based on the brief I created a brand identity for The Studded Chain, including logo, business card mock-up,
            an iPhone icon, and a client presentation presenting my research and final design solutions. From these style
            guide-lines, I created designs for a responsive mobile and desktop website. Finally, I created an interactive
            prototype in Axure, which can be seen <a href="http://s9yiui.axshare.com/#c=2">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>
            The first step in the process was research into the competition. I looked at the logos and brand identities of
            some existing bicycle shops, to get a feel for current trends. I tended to see bright, vivid colours, and
            an emphasis on simple circular shapes. Motifs such as chains and gears cropped up again and again.
        </p>

        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            In an effort to create an identity that was “fresh and current”, I also looked at current web design
            trends. I found an emphasis on high-quality, filtered photography with text overlays, grid layouts, flat
            bands of colour and pure CSS buttons.
        </p>

        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            The unique selling point of The Studded Chain is its emphasis on vintage bicycles and so I could use more
            subtle colours to emphasise a more hip, independant feel, and set it aside from the larger chain stores.
        </p>
        <h4>Visual Design</h4>
        <p>
            The first challenge I approached was creating the logo. It needed to embody the whole brand identity, so
            that I could use it as a starting point for other design decisions later.
        </p>
        <p>
            I opted for a simple geometric semi-circle logo with soft colours. The wheel motif envokes the symbolism of
            new beginnings, fitting for a shop that gives new life to old bicycles. The bold cursive font was chosen to
            appear friendly, and the typewritten style font gives a more ‘old-time’ feel.
        </p>
        <div class="section group">
            <img border="0" alt="Colour Logo" src="../images/studdedChainImages/finalLogoGreen.png" class="col span_1_of_3">
            <img border="0" alt="Grey Logo" src="../images/studdedChainImages/finalLogoGrey.png" class="col span_1_of_3">

            Final logo designs and iPhone icon
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            From the logo design, I was able to create the style guidelines for the brand, in the form of a style tile.
            This would provide the design direction for the website and any other online or printed materials for the
            brand. It includes font and colour choices, and possible buttons, icons, headings and textures.
        </p>

            Style Tile
        </div>
        <h4>Website Design</h4>
        <p>
            The first step in designing the website was to analyse the basic componants needed in a bicycle shop website, and to create a diagram outlining the structure of the pages. At this point, I found it useful to think in a ‘mobile-first’ mindset, so that I could strip the design down to what is really needed.
        </p>
        <div class="fullWidthImage">
            <img src="../images/studdedChainImages/siteMap.png" alt="Site Map" width="100%">
            Website site map
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            With a plan in place for the contents of each page, I set to making wireframes for both mobile and desktop sites. I based my design around a responsive 12 column grid, so that the final design could be built for both mobile and desktop.
        </p>
        <h4>Desktop Mock-Ups</h4>
        <p>
            With wireframes done, the next step was to create high-fidelity mock-ups of the ‘Home’, ‘About’  and ‘Bicycles’ pages. I used Adobe Illustrator to create the mock-ups, and the photographs are ones that I found online, and edited in Photoshop. If the project was for a client, these would be replaced with original photographs.
        </p>

            <img border="0" alt="About Page Desktop" src="../images/studdedChainImages/deskAbout.jpg" class="col span_1_of_2">
        </div>
        <h4>Mobile Mock-Ups</h4>
        <div class="section group">
            <img border="0" alt="Mobile Home Page" src="../images/studdedChainImages/mobileHome.jpg" class="col span_1_of_3">

            <img border="0" alt="Mobile Product Page 2" src="../images/studdedChainImages/mobileBikes2.jpg" class="col span_1_of_3">
        </div>
        <h4>Content Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            From the high-fi mock-ups I created a content analysis document detailing the assets needed for every page, so that they can be easily saved down to the right sizes and put into the code. A clear naming convention is needed for files so that they can be easily recognised in the development stage.
        </p>

        <h4>Interactive Prototype</h4>
        <p>
            Finally, I created an interactive prototype of the website using Axure.  Explore it at <a href="http://s9yiui.axshare.com/#c=2">http://s9yiui.axshare.com/#c=2</a>.
